docker_run
==========

girder_worker provides a built-in task that can be used to run docker containers.
girder_worker makes it easy to work on data held in girder from with a
docker containers.

Container arguments
-------------------

The ``docker_run`` task exposes a ``container_args`` parameter which can be using
to pass arguments to the container entrypoint.


Volumes
-------

The volumes to be mount into a container can me pass to the ``docker_run`` task
in one of two ways.

Using docker-py syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this case the value of the ``volumes`` parameter is a ``dict`` conforming to
specification defined by `docker-py <http://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/containers.html>`_,
this is passed directly to docker-py. For example

.. code-block:: python

    volumes = {
         '/home/docker/data': {
             'bind': '/mnt/docker/',
             'mode': 'rw'
         }

    }
    docker_run.delay('my/image', pull_image=True, volumes=volumes)

Using the Volume class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

girder_worker provides a utility class ``Volume`` that can be using to define volumes
that should be mount into a container. These class can also be using in conjection
with other part of the girder_work docker infrastructure, for example providing a location
where a file should be downloaded to. See `Downloading files from Girder`_. When using
the ``Volume`` class a list on instances is provided as the value for the ``volumes``
parameter, girder_work will take care of ensuring that these volumes are mount. In the
example below we are creating a ``Volume`` instance and passing it as a container
argument to provide the mounted location to the container. girder_worker will take
care of transforming the instance into the approriate path inside the container.

.. code-block:: python

    vol = Volume('/home/docker/data', '/mnt/docker/')
    docker_run.delay('my/image', pull_image=True, volumes=[vol], container_args=[vol])

Temporary Volume
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``TemporaryVolume`` class is provided representing a temporary directory on the host
machine that is mounted into the container. ``TemporaryVolume.default`` holds a default
instance that is used as the default location for many other parts of the girder_worker docker
infrastructure for example when downloading file. See `Downloading files from Girder`_.
However, it can also be using explicity for example, here it is being passed as a
container argument for use within a container. Again, girder_worker will take care
of transforming the ``TemporaryVolume`` instance into the appropriate path inside
the container, so the container entrypoint will simply recieve a path.

.. code-block:: python

    vol = Volume('/home/docker/data', '/mnt/docker/')
    docker_run.delay('my/image', pull_image=True, container_args=[TemporaryVolume.default])

Note that we don't have to add the instance to the ``volumes`` parameter as it is
automatically added to the list of volumes to mount.

Downloading files from Girder
-----------------------------

Accessing files held in girder from within a container is straight forward using
the ``GirderFileIdToVolume`` utility class. One simply provides the file id as
a argument to the constructor and pass the instance as a container argument.

.. code-block:: python

    docker_run.delay('my/image', pull_image=True,
        container_args=[GirderFileIdToVolume(file_id)])

The ``GirderFileIdToVolume`` instance will take care of downloading the file from
Girder and passes the path it was download to the docker containers entrypoint as an argument.

If no ``volume`` parameter is specified then the file will be downloading to the
task temporary volume. The file can also be downloaded to a specific ``Volume`` by
specifying a volume parameter, as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    vol = Volume(host_path, container_path)
    docker_run.delay('my/image', pull_image=True,
        container_args=[GirderFileIdToVolume(file_id,volume=vol)])

If the being downloaded is particularly large you may want to consider streaming
it into the container using a named pipe. See `Streaming Girder files into a container`_
for more details.

Uploading files to Girder items
-------------------------------

Utility classes are also provide to simplify uploading files generated by a the
docker container. The ``GirderUploadVolumePathToItem`` provides the functionality
to upload a file to an item. In the example below, we using the ``VolumePath``
utility class to define a file path that we then pass to the docker container.
The docker container can write data to this file path. As well as passing the
``VolumePath`` instance as a container argument we also pass it to ``GirderUploadVolumePathToItem``
, the ``GirderUploadVolumePathToItem`` instance is add to ``girder_result_hooks``. This
tell girder_work to upload the file path to the item id provided when the docker
container has finished running.


.. code-block:: python

    volumepath = VolumePath('write_data_to_be_upoaded.txt')
    docker_run.delay('my/image', pull_image=True, container_args=[volumepath],
        girder_result_hooks=[GirderUploadVolumePathToItem(volumepath, item_id)])


Using named pipes to stream data in and out of containers
---------------------------------------------------------

girder_worker uses named pipes as a language agnostic way of streaming data in
and out of docker containers. Basically a named pipe is created at a path that is
mounted into the container. This allows the container to open that pipe for read or
write and similarly the girder_worker infrastructure can open the pipe on the host,
thus allow data write and read from the container.

The are two utility classes using to represent as named pipe, ``NamedOutputPipe``
and ``NamedInputPipe``

NamedOuputPipe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This represents a named pipe that will be opened in the docker container for write.
So is using to stream data out of a container.


NamedInputPipe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This represents a named pipe that will be opened in the docker container for read.
So is using to stream data into a container.

These pipes can be connected to other streams using the ``Connect`` untility class.


Streaming Girder files into a container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One great example of using a named pipe is to stream a potentially large file into
a container. This approach allow the task to start process straight away rather
than have to wait for the either file to download, it also removed the requirement
that the file is held on the local filesystem. In the example below we are creating
an instance of ``GirderFileIdToStream`` that provides the ability to download a
file in chunks. We are also creating a named pipe called ``read_in_container``,
as not ``volume`` argument is provided this pipe will be created on the temporary
volume automatically mounted by girder_worker. Finally we are using the ``Connect``
class to "connect" the stream to the pipe, we pass the instance as a container
argument. girder_worker will take care of the select logic to stream the file into
the pipe.


.. code-block:: python

    stream = GirderFileIdToStream(file_id)
    pipe = NamedInputPipe('read_in_container')
    docker_run('my/image', pull_image=True, container_args=[Connect(stream, pipe)])

Allow the container has todo is open path passed into the container entry point
and start reading. Below is an example python entry point:

.. code-block:: python

    # Simply open the path passed into the container.
    with open(sys.argv[1]) as fp:
        fp.read() # This will be reading the files contents



Using "Chunked transfer encoding" to upload data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
